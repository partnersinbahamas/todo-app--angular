[DEMOLINK](https://partnersinbahamas.github.io/todo-app--angular/)

`TodoApp` is a task management application developed using Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Sass, and following the BEM methodology. The application utilizes various Angular features and concepts:

- `NgModel` and `ReactiveForms`: Used for managing data and forms within the application.

- `Input`, `Output`, and `EventEmitter`: Enabling data exchange between parent and child components.

- `ViewChild`: Providing access to DOM elements from within components.

- `Life Cycle Methods`: Used for managing the lifecycle of components, such as ngOnInit, ngOnDestroy, and others.

- `Change Detection Strategy`: Employed for optimizing performance by controlling change detection.

- `Pipes`: Used for data transformation in templates, such as date formatting.

- `Services`: Organized to handle business logic and data exchange between components.

- `Observables` and `Subjects`: Leveraged for asynchronous programming and managing data streams.

- `Router`: Facilitating navigation between different parts of the application and supporting routing.

- `Lazy Loading`: Implemented to optimize application loading by dynamically loading parts of the application as needed.

This application allows users to create, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed, as well as view them in various modes (active, completed) and filter them by status.
